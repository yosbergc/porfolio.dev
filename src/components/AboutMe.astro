      Hey, I'm Yosber but people know me as Emmanuel. I started programming 5 years ago
      but I consider myself an appasionate person about tech since I was a child.

    <p>
      Some things I'm happy I've done so far is create different projects helping people close to me. Also created an account on Instagram sharing some memes about programming and so far we are almost 3K! 🎊</p>
